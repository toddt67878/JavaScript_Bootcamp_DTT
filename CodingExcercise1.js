// SOLUTION:

/*
var scoreOfJohn = 80;
// var scoreOfJohn = 49;
var scoreOfNick = 45;
// var scoreOf Nick = 75;
var pass = 51;

if (scoreOfJohn >= pass && scoreOfNick >= pass) {
  console.log('Both students passed');
} else if(scoreOfJohn >= pass || scoreOfNick >= pass) {
  console.log('One of the students passed:')

   if (scoreOfJohn > scoreOfNick) {
     console.log('and it is John with ' + scoreOfJohn + ' points');
   } else {
     console.log('and it is Nick with ' + scoreOfNick + ' points');
   }
} else {
  console.log('Both of the students failed');
